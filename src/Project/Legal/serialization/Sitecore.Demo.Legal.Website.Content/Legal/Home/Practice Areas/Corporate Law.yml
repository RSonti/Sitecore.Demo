        <p style="margin-left: 13.5pt;">Over the many years we have in business, Habitat Legal have built a world-leading reputation in the complex field of Corporate Governance, working with some of the globally prominent corporations and organisations in the public eye. </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 13.5pt;">Since the 2008 financial crisis, corporate governance practices around accountability of many high-profile organisations has gained focus. In tandem with the collapse of a number of these during the early 2000&rsquo;s, driven by many cases of fraudulent accounting, is forcing corporations to look more closely at their internal governance.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-left: 13.5pt;">Corporate Governance Key Principles:</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Rights and equitable treatment of shareholders
            <p class="bulletPara">Ensuring mechanisms are in place to enable shareholders to exercise their rights and partake in general meetings, giving them full and open communication channels.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Other stakeholders interest
            <p class="bulletPara">Solidifying the understanding of the corporation of their obligations to other, non-shareholding parties, who maintain a vested interest. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Roles and responsibilities of the board
            <p class="bulletPara"> Supporting the members of the board to guarantee relevant skills are possessed to review and nurture organisation-wide management performance and commitment. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Integrity and ethical behavior
            <p class="bulletPara">Corporations need to embrace an internal culture which upholds ethical and responsible practices, which through a Code of Conduct, can be adopted through the organisation. It is also imperative, board members are selected who display high levels of integrity, from both a business and personal perspectives. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Disclosure and transparency
            <p class="bulletPara">A key imperative for all modern corporations in the &lsquo;dot com&rsquo; age, regardless of industry or vertical. From the public publication of roles and responsibilities of the entire management team to the implementation of processes which allow independent verification of financial reporting and everything in between. The publication of these materials, and the content within, must always be written in a balanced, factual manner, while ensuring a appropriate time-frame for delivery.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
